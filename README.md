for this Assignment I chose this music dataset with various features pertaining to their rank on the Billboard 200 and details about the music like tempo start and end, loundness, and various other small details. This would be good in predicting whether a song will be successful or not. Also finding whether most songs follow the same pattern or the difference in each song is large enough to be distinct.
